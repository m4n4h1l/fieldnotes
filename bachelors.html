                <h3>weaving the threads: history, code, and policy</h3>
                <p>how do you build a more just future without understanding the past? how do you serve people without understanding the systems that shape their lives?</p>
                <p>these are the questions that drive my academic journey at sarah lawrence college. I don't believe the answers can be found in a single discipline. that's why I'm weaving together three seemingly disparate threads: the deep, human context of history; the ethical framework of public policy; and the tangible, tool-building power of computer science.</p> 
                <p>for someone whose life has been a tapestry of different cultures and countries, a single thread was never enough (something I've written extensively about in my college admission essays). this page documents my attempt to braid them together, exploring what I'm learning, how I'm growing, and why it all matters. it is my working answer to a guiding question: how do we learn across disciplines and still stay rooted in purpose?</p>

                        <strong>[essay]:</strong> "Networking for Reform and Revolution: Guanxi in the Shift from Mao to Deng" (spring 2025)
                        <p class="placeholder-text"><em>This paper explores the evolution of guanxi (关系), the Chinese cultural concept of informal networks, from a pre-existing social norm into an essential mechanism for survival during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR). It argues that the institutional collapse and orchestrated chaos of the Mao era accelerated the importance of guanxi, entrenching it as a system of factionalism and reciprocity. Drawing on historical analysis of the Red Guards and literary reportage from the period, the paper traces how these informal networks, forged in turmoil, did not disappear but rather became deeply embedded within the bureaucracy, economy, and society of the post-Mao reform era. Ultimately, this research concludes that the legacy of the GPCR, expressed through the persistent influence of guanxi, endures as a quiet but powerful force shaping contemporary Chinese society.</em></p>

                        <strong>[conference paper]:</strong> "Imperialising, Inside-Out: Unravelling Imperial Japan's Indigenous Subjugation" (spring 2025)
                        <p class="placeholder-text"><em>This paper argues that Imperial Japan’s subjugation of its Indigenous and colonized peoples was a multifaceted "imperialising, inside-out" process that fundamentally shaped not only the identities of the colonized but also the fabric of the modern Japanese nation-state. Using the critical frameworks of settler colonialism, colonial modernity, and postcolonial theory, this research analyzes and compares the assimilationist policies of dōka in Hokkaido and the imperialization movement of kōminka in Taiwan. Through these case studies, the paper demonstrates how Japan's colonial project deployed distinct strategies to dismantle native societies and manufacture imperial subjects, a process that ultimately transformed Japan itself. The conclusion asserts that contemporary Ainu resilience offers a significant revision to Japan’s national narrative and that a direct confrontation with this history is essential for building a more inclusive future.</em></p>
