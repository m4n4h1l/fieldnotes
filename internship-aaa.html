                <h3>my role & the organization</h3>
                <p>from may to august 2025, I am serving as an immigration support services intern at the alliance for african assistance (aaa) in san diego. aaa is a nonprofit dedicated to providing comprehensive services to refugees, asylees, and immigrants, helping them achieve self-sufficiency and thrive in their new communities.</p>
                <p>while my official role involves supporting the immigration team, I quickly saw where my unique skills could make a different kind of impact. after one afternoon spent searching unsuccessfully through hundreds of pages of paper case files for a single, crucial notice, the inefficiency of the existing system became impossible to ignore. it was clear that time spent on administrative bottlenecks was time not spent with clients who needed direct, human support.</p>
                <p class="placeholder-text"><em>that experience was the catalyst for a project I‚Äôve taken on alongside my regular duties: designing and building an entirely new client and case management system from the ground up. my goal is to create an intuitive digital tool that streamlines data entry and document retrieval. this isn't just about efficiency. it's about creating a system that gives caseworkers their most valuable resource back: time to provide the compassionate support that truly matters.</em></p>

                <h3>personal reflections</h3>

                    <div class="notepad-reflection">
                        <h4 class="notepad-title">reflection: challenges & growth ‚ú®</h4>
                        <div class="notepad-content">
                            <p>one of the biggest challenges was navigating the complex, often slow-moving bureaucratic systems that clients depend on. that afternoon I spent searching for a single document was more than just frustrating; it was a firsthand look at how broken systems can directly impact people's lives. it was a powerful lesson in patience and persistence.</p>
                            <p>this challenge, however, taught me something crucial about my own role. patience isn't just about waiting. it's about understanding why you have to wait and what is broken in the process. that frustration became my motivation. it showed me that my purpose isn't just to work within these systems, but to actively dismantle and rebuild them.</p>
                            <p>growth, for me, was realizing that my tech skills could be a form of advocacy. the decision to build a new case management system wasn't a side project; it was a direct response to this challenge. it was my way of turning a lesson in persistence into a tangible tool for change, ensuring that others wouldn't have to lose precious time to the same inefficiency.</p>

                        <div class="notepad-content">
                            <p>my origin story began the moment I translated for that first family. this internship was my attempt to chase that feeling, to move beyond theory and back into the room where the real work happens.</p>
                            <p>witnessing the quiet resilience of families navigating a new country, and the tireless dedication of the aaa staff, was more than just inspiring; it was a confirmation. it reminded me that behind every case file is a human story, and behind every systemic inefficiency is an opportunity to provide direct, compassionate support.</p>
                            <p>this experience solidified my commitment not just to service, but to a specific kind of service, one that sees the person first and then builds the system around them. that's the real lesson here. it‚Äôs the principle I carry into every line of code I write for the new case management system, and every step I take from here.</p>
