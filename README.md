## 🌟 for the love of the game

the day before my nineteenth birthday, I walked into my internship at a nonprofit with a quiet sense of dread. I didn’t want to spend another day doing data entry. updating a database from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm didn’t feel like real-world impact. **I couldn’t feel the difference I was making.**

but something was different that day. the immigration specialist at the desk beside mine had just been assigned a new family, afghan refugees. normally, I wouldn’t have much to contribute. but this time, the family had spent years in pakistanI refugee camps. the teen daughters were born and brought up in peshawar. they spoke urdu.

suddenly, I had something to offer. 

translating that morning **changed my life.**

## 📞 yes, this is she

my name is manahil. i study history, computer science, and policy. yeah, i like systems, but i **love** people.

my life is spread across four countries (you’ll see this corny bit on my socials: 🇵🇰 but 🇦🇪🇯🇵🇺🇸). if you could guide me on anything, it’d probably be how to stay still.
