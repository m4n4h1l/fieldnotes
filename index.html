                <h2>[☎️] "yes, this is she"</h2>
                <p><b>my name is manahil.</b> I study history, computer science, and policy. yeah, I <em>like</em> systems, but I <b>love</b> people.</p>
                <p> <b>[🇵🇰 but 🇦🇪🇯🇵🇺🇸]</b> my life is spread across four countries. <em>if you could guide me on anything, it’d probably be how to stay still.</em></p>
                <p> --- <br> <br> the day before my nineteenth birthday, I walked into my internship at a nonprofit with a quiet sense of dread. I didn’t want to spend another day doing data entry. updating a database from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm didn’t feel like real-world impact. I couldn’t feel the difference I was making.
<br> <br> but something was different that day. the immigration specialist at the desk beside mine had just been assigned a new family, afghan refugees. normally, I wouldn’t have much to contribute. but this time, the family had spent years in pakistanI refugee camps. the teen daughters were born and brought up in peshawar.
<br> <br> they spoke urdu.
<br> <br> suddenly, I had something to offer.
<br> <br> translating that morning changed my life.</p>
