            <h2>📞 Yes, this is she</h2>
            <p>My name is Manahil. I study history, computer science, and policy. Yeah, I like systems, but I love people.</p>
            <p>My life is spread across four countries (🇵🇰 but 🇦🇪🇯🇵🇺🇸). If you could guide me on anything, it’d probably be how to stay still.</p>
