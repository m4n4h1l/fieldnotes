            <p><em>a public record of service work, research and reflectionsâ€¦ all grounded in non-zero days.</em></p>
            <p>This is where you can introduce the core concept of "fieldnotes." You mentioned "ðŸŒŸ for the love of the game" â€“ perhaps the story starts here or is linked from here.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ“ž Yes, this is she</h2>
            <p>My name is Manahil. I study history, computer science, and policy. Yeah, I like systems, but I love people.</p>
            <p>My life is spread across four countries (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° but ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸). If you could guide me on anything, itâ€™d probably be how to stay still.</p>

            <h2>Goals & Projects</h2>
            <p>Here, you can introduce your goals. We'll later work on how to display these and link them to specific project pages, each with its own blog feed.</p>
