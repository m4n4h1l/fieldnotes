## ğŸŒŸ for the love of the game

the day before my nineteenth birthday, i walked into my internship at a nonprofit with a quiet sense of dread. i didnâ€™t want to spend another day doing data entry. updating a database from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm didnâ€™t feel like real-world impact. **i couldnâ€™t feel the difference i was making.**

but something was different that day. the immigration specialist at the desk beside mine had just been assigned a new family â€” afghan refugees. normally, i wouldnâ€™t have much to contribute. but this time, the family had spent years in pakistani refugee camps. the teen daughters were born and brought up in peshawar. they spoke urdu.

suddenly, i had something to offer.

translating that morning **changed my life.**
