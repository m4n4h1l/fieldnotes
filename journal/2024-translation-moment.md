the day before my nineteenth birthday, i walked into my internship with dread. i didnâ€™t want to do more data entry...

but that day, a family of afghan refugees arrived. the daughters had grown up in peshawar. they spoke urdu. suddenly, i had something to offer.

translating for them changed my relationship to the work.
